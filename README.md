# applemoji
An Open-Source library for Apple emojis

# Why did you make this?
I am honestly a huge fan of the apple emoji pallet and its unique design style. The problem is, their emojis are only available on apple devices. applemoji helps change that and makes those cool and visually appealing emojis available to everyone on every platform.
