# applemoji's web scraper code
Like i earlier mentioned, all the emojis here are from here [https://unicode.org/emoji/charts/full-emoji-list.html]. had to build this web scraper to scrap the site and get the data i needed for this library, note that the data gotten might not be perfect or not match the emoji it should, please feel free to correct and report any issues here [https://github.com/FotieMConstant/applemojis/issues] or open a PR to correct the issue here: [https://github.com/FotieMConstant/applemojis/pulls]

thanks!
